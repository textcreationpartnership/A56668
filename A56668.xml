            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The greateſt buſtle and ſtir is about, <hi>Religion the Means;</hi> viz. Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, Prayer, Hearing of Sermons, good Diſcourſe, and ſuch like things. About which men have wrangled ſo long, and have been ſo
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:64706:4"/>much concerned to beat down the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion oppoſite to their own, that at laſt they have, in a manner, forgot that there is any thing elſe to be regarded, and have made theſe the Sum of their Religion; at leaſt, the greateſt part of it. Inſomuch, that to tell them this plain Truth, <hi>That Faith in Chriſt is it ſelf but a means to ſome thing higher, and not to be reſted in,</hi> is to raiſe a Controverſie; and make a new Stir among thoſe who are as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as they are zealous.

No Prayers, ſome think, will obtain the bleſſings they need, or diſpoſe the Soul for the Divine Grace, and promote the love of God and man in their hearts, unleſs they be every time in new Words, and in a new Order and Method: which in truth ſerves more to gratify the Fancy than to alter the Will and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and pleaſes our ſelves rather
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:64706:5"/>than God. Sermons alſo about that which I called <hi>Religion the End</hi> are not ſo well liked; they would have them rather about the <hi>Means.</hi> Nor is it ſufficient to hear an holy Inſtruction or Exhortation on the Lords Day, and the Scriptures read at other ſolemn times; or to acknowledge God, and expreſs our Faith and Hope in him, our Love to him and Deſire to be like him, in his Publique Worſhip, in our own Families and Cloſets; but there muſt be other <hi>Meetings</hi> and <hi>Daies</hi> obſerved of mens own private Invention and Appointment: or elſe all Religion they think is in danger to be loſt, and they muſt queſtion, whether thoſe have the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi> that do not frequent them? By this means, the Simplicity of Religion, and the true Power of Godlineſs, it muſt be acknowledged, is very much decaied. Many ſpend that time about the <hi>Means,</hi> which they ought to ſpend in that God-like Life to which they are deſigned; nay, they uſe thoſe
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:64706:5"/>Means in ſuch a manner, that they hinder rather than promote true God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. But there is a worſe thing ſtill behind.</p>
            <p>Let any man attempt to apply a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to theſe Miſchiefs, by making a plain Diſcovery of ſuch Miſtakes; preſently a terrible Perſecution is raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him, and a Troop, or Army rather, of enraged Zealots not only aſſault and wound, but endeavour to deſtroy his Reputation. Though his Words be never ſo plain and eaſie to be underſtood, though the Compoſition of his Diſcourſe be perſpicuous, and though he expreſs, in ſo many words, out of the Holy Scriptures, what ſolid and true Religion is; yet he ſhall be voted an <hi>Enemy to it,</hi> an <hi>Inſtrument of Satan,</hi> an <hi>Underminer of all Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Godlineſs,</hi> (ſo they have learnt to call Praying and Diſcourſing about good things, and ſuch like matters) He whoſe Religion only alters the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and buſies himſelf in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Face, and ordering the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:64706:6"/>of the Head, ſhall ſooner be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, though he pour out an hundred Lies; than that well-deſigning Perſon, who ſtudies to bridle his tongue, to ſpeak nothing but the Truth, and to order his Life according to the Will of God. Theſe ſhall all be diſparaged and vilified by an empty and talkative Devotion, which ſhall be preferred much before them.</p>
            <p>You may think this to be ſcarce cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible: but when you conſider the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of ſome, the Weakneſs of other mens Natural Parts, the naughty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that moſt are poſſeſſed withal, and bring along with them to the reading of Books, even of the Holy Scriptures; and how Truth it ſelf was rejected when it came in Perſon into the World, and the ſacred Volumns have been ſo wreſted that the abſurdeſt Fictions have been made out of them; you will not wonder that a Pious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe meets with this Bad Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Either men conſider not that ſome Truths lie deep, and muſt be drawn up with a great deal of labour;
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:64706:6"/>or they have not indifferent Minds, but ſuffer their Deſires and Wiſhes to form their Opinions for them. They run over a Book in poſt-haſt, and only ſpend a few ſlight thoughts upon it; or they want that Honeſty and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of heart, which is neceſſary to a right <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding. They are fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent to maintain their own conceits, they are blinded by the Love of this World, or by Anger and Hatred of others, or by a proud and vain Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of themſelves, which riſe up to contradict the plaineſt Truth that ſtrikes at them. And of all the reſt nothing more indiſpoſes the Soul, and prejudices it againſt the Truth, than that laeſt thing now named, a vain Conceit of themſelves; which makes men bold and confident, apt to cenſure rather than to learn, to be angry at all Reproofs, and to conclude that is falſe which they do not inſtantly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.

If they will, they need but read what is writ already, and there they will find an Anſwer themſelves, without any more ado. But further Thoughts perſwaded me to reſolve
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:64706:12"/>otherwiſe: becauſe there are many men who know well enough he hath miſſed the Mark, that are contented not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Book ſhould paſs for an Anſwer; and will commend it, till the Nakedneſs of it be diſcovered.

This makes a Show of Religion and of Wiſdom too; and though it be nothing to the purpoſe, there ſeems to be much of God in it. As there are confident Ninnies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Garb of Wiſe men, and Sententious Abſurdities that carry the appearance of Aphoriſms; So there is a bluſtering Language which looks like Rhetorick, ridiculous Conceits which make a ſhow of Wit, and ignorant Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in Holy Phraſe, who ſeem like great Divines.

            <p>But I ſhould write a new Book, ſhould I proceed to repreſent only all the weak and ungrounded Concluſions which this Man makes in that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. Who he is, I have plainly enough ſignified to thoſe who will be at the pains to read this Dialogue; relying chiefly upon his own confeſſion to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons, though it is eaſie enough other ways to find him out.

               <hi>Why doſt thou make ſuch haſt to injure him, whom thou oughteſt rather to love, for declaring what opinion all have of thee? Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences have often corrected and ſet ſtraight men of ingenuous ſpirits, by making way for a cure of that which they have contumeliouſly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If therefore thou thinkeſt thoſe things reproachful which thou haſt heard, preſerve thy ſelf by well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unreproachable.

               <p>Why may I not tell you a few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Devices that have been in uſe to win and keep your Proſelytes?

               <p>It was a thing notorious in the late times, as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> aſſures us; and I have cauſe to think this evil hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is not ſpent, but rather encreaſed. But be that as it will; you have a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of far more efficacious Arts then this. As, to vaunt of the power of your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64706:23"/>preaching, of the glorious appearance of God among you, and of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Converts to you; to beſpatter all that oppoſe you; to perſwade the people, it was good livings that made ſo many turn Conformiſts; and that they have loſt their gifts, and are much decreaſed in their graces: at leaſt you have thought good to terrifie them, and bid them take heed; for they have loſt the prayers of thouſands. But if any adventure to write againſt you; wo be to them. Whatſoever they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, immediately they become the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of God and all goodneſs. The people are told, that they ſtrike at the power of godlineſs through your ſides; and that they reproach Religion, when they reprove your Superſtition. Every reprehenſion is called railing and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the people of God; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever fault they find, it is done on purpoſe, you ſay, to bring all godlineſs into contempt. In ſhort, to ſuppreſs you, is to ſuppreſs the Spirit; and but to ſpeak againſt your affected language, is to be deſperately profane: for who ever ſaw <hi>the beauty of Sion, and the glory of the Lord filling the Tabernacle,</hi> but in your Congregations? Let any man go
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64706:23"/>about to contradict this, it is but pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out half a dozen Scriptures againſt him, nothing to the purpoſe, and he is confuted; nay, one word will do the work, and he ſhall be thought to write rarely, and to come off like an Angel, who can but ſay; <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi>

               <p>I promiſe you to conſider every thing as gravely and as impartially as I can; to anſwer you alſo without any puns, which he calls jeſts, in which I dare not vie with him. And, to ſpeak plainly, it is a thing much below me; beſides, that his wit is ſo deſpicable, as I told you, that there are boys of 17. and of no great parts neither, who are much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to him. I will endeavour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſpeak pertinently to the buſineſs, and not ramble as he doth. We will have no great Volume neither, for I know he can write Books with moſt men for a Wager: A <hi>Martyrology</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64706:41"/>the Country Tales, and that work is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht. And then for a ſhew of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is nothing need be done (as a Friend of the Author of <hi>D.

As for example, when he Treats of Liberty and Thraldom, he may cite that, <hi>Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro;</hi> (You underſtand it, I ſuppoſe, or at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is Scholar-like.)

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64706:41"/>ſo familiar with this Author, and he hath contracted ſuch an acquaintance with them, that they will all run to him at an hours warning, and will leave me never an one to aſſiſt me. Therefore I ſhall of my own accord wave them all, and deſire them to ſtand by, or go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe ſervice they pleaſe; intending to ſhift as well as I can without them. Now what have you to ſay? I am not only a ſingle perſon, as you ſee, but quite naked and diſarm'd of all thoſe weapons wherewith he is ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; ſo that you may hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, if Truth cannot defend me.

               <p>I remember his words; and they are another notable Demonſtration of the Hypocritical modeſty, that is, the ſhameleſs boldneſs of this man, who will venture to ſay any thing, merely out of his own head, which he thinks may diſgrace me; and indeavour without any proof, to make the world believe,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64706:56"/>that I pin my Faith on <hi>Grotius</hi> his ſleeve, and make him in ſtead of a <hi>God.</hi> This he repeats I cannot tell how often, (as he ſhall hear anon with a witneſs) and, I will repeat it too, only out of that great forge, where the reſt of his Book was wrought, his own imagination. For I proteſt ſincerely, it is more than I know, if that be his Interpretation which I gave you: nor did I in all my life, to my beſt remembrance, conſult with him about it.

From whence I concluded that they were to be anointed alſo with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (or the <hi>Spirit</hi>) and with <hi>Power,</hi> as he had been. And ſo they were; for as at his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended on him like a Dove (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16.) ſo on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> which was the day of their Baptiſm (<hi>Acts</hi> 1.5.) they were all filled with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> propheſying and ſpeaking with tongues (as the <hi>Spirit</hi> gave them utterance) and preſently working a great Miracle upon the Creeple, and with <hi>great power</hi> giving witneſs of his Reſurrection

Theſe, and ſuch like conſiderations were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to perſwade me to incline to that ſenſe of the words which I gave you. But when I attended to the ſcope of the Apoſtles diſcourſe, I had no doubt left in me: nothing ſo well agreeing with it (whatſoever this man prates) as that Interpretation. For the <hi>Spirit and Power</hi> is that which proved the Truth of the Apoſtles Preaching better than any Syllogiſms, or artificial Orations could do, which he therefore calls a

Now how he came to be beſt acquainted with <hi>this Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or prefer it before all others (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that large one with his own hand to it) one cannot well conceive, might a man ſay, unleſs it be for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that people love their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64706:73"/>better than any elſe. But for a this I conclude nothing. Let me only ask, which way you will conclude in this caſe? Did he know there was this Alteration made in the texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that this which he quotes was not in the Edition to which he hath given his Approbation under his hand; or did he not? If not, then he is not ſo well skill'd in your Divines as he pretends, nor fit to talk of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; he is a ſtranger to his <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and recommends that to the peoples remembrance, which he forgets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If he did know; then I ask how he durſt tell us this in the name of the Aſſembly, and ſay they prove their propoſition by this place, when his Conſcience told him they did not? Is it not an high degree of wickedneſs to countenance, or indeavour to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſuch a fraud? May not all your party juſtly buffet him, for abuſing the Aſſembly and making them write that which they never meant? For he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly tells us, <hi>they quote this place, Iſa.</hi> 33.22. which, as it is nothing to the purpoſe, ſo was not choſen by them to back their doctrine withal.</p>

               <p>I think the Title page of that Edition tells you, that the proofs in words at length, are either ſome of the <hi>formerly quoted places,</hi> or others gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from <hi>the Aſſemblies other writings.</hi>

               <p>Its well obſerved; for it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a change, according to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans judgment and not their own. And this <hi>Phil.</hi> if he had been the man he would be taken for, would have carefully noted. And ſince he was ſpeaking of the Aſſemblies opinion he ought not to have alledged any proofs of it, but thoſe which they quoted themſelves for it; eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he wholly relyes on that place of Scripture to ſhew their ſenſe. As for him who made the Alteration, he did not deal ſincerely and as became an upright man. For where ſhall we find this new proof in <hi>their other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings?</hi> They never wrote any thing elſe about theſe matters but the larger Catechiſm and the Confeſſion of Faith,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64706:74"/>and there is no ſuch Scripture alledged in either of thoſe when they ſpeak of this buſineſſe. And now I mention the <hi>larger Catechiſme</hi> again, of which the leſter is an abridgment; one would think it had been more fit for him to fetch the explication of their words and take their meaning from thence, rather than from the corrupt gloſſes put upon the <hi>ſhorter.</hi> For they could better expreſs their own mind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than any of their Diſciples. Now if you go thither, you ſhall find they determine faith to the promiſes as its object, and make it a reſting on Chriſt and his righteouſneſs for pardon of ſin and accepting our perſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention of any reſpect to him as a <hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>King.</hi> Let us read the words. <hi>Juſtifying Faith is a ſaving grace wrought in the heart of a ſinner by the Spirit and word of God, whereby being convinced of Sin and miſery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he not only aſſents to the truth of the promiſe of the Goſpel, but receives and reſts upon Chriſt and his righteouſneſs therein held forth, for pardon of ſin, and for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting and accounting of his perſon righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the ſight of God for Salvation.</hi> Judge now whether I wrong'd you in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64706:74"/>that which I ſaid concerning Faith, which it is plain you have been taught to think is nothing elſe in effect but this, to rely upon Chriſt for forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins. And ſhould your Child ask you the meaning of thoſe words in the ſhorter <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> and ſay, <hi>How is Chriſt held forth or offered to us in the Goſpel?</hi> I pray tell me what Anſwer you would return. Would not you, who are exhorted to read thoſe Books and inſtruct your Family out of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him in this manner? <hi>Child,</hi> the larger Catechiſme, which you muſt learn next, informs you, that he is <hi>held forth as our righteouſneſſe,</hi> and ſo you muſt <hi>receive him and reſt on him for pardon and accepting of your perſon as righteous, according to the promiſe of the Goſpel.</hi>

               <p>I think I ſhould teach them in that manner. But I remember withal that in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith.</hi> chap. 14. they tell us ſomething elſe, viz. that the <hi>Principal Acts of ſaving Faith are receiving and reſting on Chriſt alone for Juſtification, Sanctification, and eternal life by virtue of the Covenant of Grace.</hi>

               <p>True. But you know that this is not ſo much read as the other, and is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64706:75"/>more fitted for Divines than you; not are any of you wont to read it, till you have the former perſwaſion rooted in your hearts. Beſides, they do not ſpeak here of <hi>Faith as juſtifying,</hi> but of the principal acts of <hi>ſaving Faith:</hi> and you know they uſe to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two. They put alſo <hi>relying on him for Juſtification</hi> in the firſt place: and more than that, in the eleventh Chapter, which is concerning <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> they tell you, that <hi>Faith receiving and reſting on Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs is the alone Inſtrument of Juſtification.</hi> And therefore the common opinion is, that it <hi>Juſtifies</hi> as it hath a reſpect to the blood of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. But I have a more mighty Argument to prove that this is the Orthodox ſenſe of that Aſſembly, which is from the Parliament it ſelf. Who in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. 1645. giving <hi>Rules and Directions</hi> concerning Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, in caſe of <hi>Ignorance or Scandal,</hi> deliver this Definition of Faith which a <hi>Communicant</hi> is to be inſtructed in, <hi>It is a grace whereby we believe and truſt in Chriſt for remiſſion of ſin and life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, according to the promiſe of the

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64706:82"/>any crime, or any thing that was ever done; which you ſee is not true. To what purpoſe doth he tell me of it, unleſs he firſt prove that it is but <hi>three years</hi> ſince, <hi>June</hi> 24. 1660? If he can do this, he will be as great a man as he thinks himſelf: otherwiſe, he is an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent reviler,</hi> in proclaiming me ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and ſo lowdly, a moſt high and grievous offender againſt a Law which is out of date; and which, if it were in force, I had no way broke. And yet, now that I bethink my ſelf, he muſt prove that it will never be more than <hi>three</hi> years ſince 1660. otherwiſe, he is a <hi>ſhameleſs Lyar,</hi> in ſaying the Act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that their crimes ſhould be <hi>no more</hi> objected, and <hi>never more</hi> rehearſed, as you have heard.

               <p>And yet how unfit he is to be your Advocate in that cauſe, appears by the lame account which he gives us of many things belonging to it.

Why? Firſt of all, he tells us, the <hi>N.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64706:97"/>are in charity with all the Saints.</hi> They are much obliged to you for your great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and courteſie.

But his Friends would have taught him to have granted more (only he knows lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as I told you, of what hath been ſaid or done) and bid him add, <hi>that it doth not bind them to go beyond their place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do good</hi>

Let's prick up our ears now, and hear what he tells us in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place; for he gapes as if he would hold forth ſome notable point. <hi>Nay Sir,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the N.

                  <note n="y" place="margin">P. 260.</note>. Mark how timorouſly the Gentleman <hi>walks up on the Ice</hi> (which he hath done before now
<note n="z" place="margin">
                     <hi>They are his words,</hi> p. 257.</note>) and what great care he takes that he catch not a fall. He will not paſs his word for all the <hi>N. C.</hi> There are, you may be ſure, <hi>many of them,</hi> he cannot tell how many, who have arrived to ſuch
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64706:98"/>a degree of honeſty, that they will no do a ſinful thing together with many good things. But ſome it ſeems, be fears, are of another opinion, <hi>and think they may do a ſinful thing for the ſake of a great many good.</hi> Theſe are brave lads: And I doubt not, whoſoever they are, but they will find a great many good things to bring to paſs, when they have a mind to make another Rebellion. But this is not all; he deſires we ſhould underſtand in the <hi>third</hi> place, that <hi>the N. C. or ſome of them do yield this,</hi> that they are not bound by an Oath or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>to that which is impoſſible to be done</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Ib.</note>. Doth he not advance very much in his Conceſſions? and come nearer and nearer to us? When <hi>ſome of them (for any thing he knows,</hi> I muſt in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity put in, for his relief) think they are bound to do even impoſſible things. Nay, <hi>many</hi> of them may be of that mind, for he dares not venture ſo far as he did before. It is not the <hi>N. C.</hi> or <hi>many</hi> of them, but only the <hi>N.

Wo be to us, when theſe men are angry.

               <p>I crave your pardon, if I do not believe you: I have cauſe to think he knows not One. For among all my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, I could never meet with a man that knows, or ſuſpects, ſo much as one ſingle Miniſter to be of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. And one would think, that Conformiſts ſhould be known to one another, better than to ſuch triflers as he. Therefore I cannot but look on this as a piece of his diſingenuity and ſpight, (of which I told you, I would give an inſtance.) <hi>Socinian</hi> he knows is an odious name, and ſo he would willingly faſten it on ſome of us, if he could: the better to ſtir up the Peoples hatred againſt all
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64706:105"/>thoſe whom they pleaſe to imagine men of that ſtrain. And for the very ſame cauſe, I doubt not, he talks of our <hi>Idolizing Grotius.</hi> It is a popular word, as was ſaid the laſt time we met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he hath not yet forgot. Whenſoever they would have any thing hated, it is but ſaying that ſuch and ſuch make an <hi>Idol</hi> of it, and immediately the People will abhor both it and them. Thus they ſaid, we <hi>made an Idol</hi> of the late King. And you may eaſily know with a little recollection, who it was that told a Gentleman when he ſaid Grace, and pray'd God would bleſs the King, (a little before his Death) <hi>Your Idol ſhall not ſtand long.</hi> But they dare not talk of Kings now: and yet the People muſt be perſwaded that we have ſtill ſome <hi>Idol</hi> to worſhip, and who ſhould it be but <hi>Grotius?</hi> (a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion as falſe as the Father of Lies can invent) together with another Image, like that of <hi>Nobuchadnezzar</hi>'s, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.32. <hi>which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you too much adore, and would have others do the like</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Pag. 14.</note>. <q>But it can no more ſtand before the more ſelect parcels of <hi>another Statue</hi> which you decry, than <hi>Dagon</hi> could before the Ark.</q> No, it trembles and quakes
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64706:105"/>already, (<hi>witneſs your own fears,</hi> ſaith he,) the very ſound of <hi>Idol,</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Dagon,</hi> is able to do the buſineſs. It is as ſtrong as a mighty wind to ſtir up the Peoples Paſſions, and put them into a hurry againſt us: Eſpecially when they are perſwaded the <hi>Ark</hi> is among theſe men; or if the <hi>Ark of God</hi> be taken, and the <hi>Ordinances</hi> a while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> (you know the meaning of this <hi>Gibberiſh</hi>) it will return again with a vengeance.</p>

And now I call to mind the Author of that ſaying which he carps at, only he ſaith <hi>ſcarce,</hi> and I ſaid <hi>never</hi> a wiſe word: and that is Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Original of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi>

The ſum of it is this. <hi>Muſing</hi> and <hi>dreaming</hi> are very near of kin: the Fanſie in both being apt to weave in every circumſtance or occurrent that hath the leaſt ſemblance or connexion with the principal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repreſented, or thought upon. For in <hi>Dreams,</hi> the principal ſenſe, which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64706:108"/>ſhould judg, being faſt bound with ſleep, cannot examine the intimations given by the fanſie, and ſo every thing paſſes current which it ſuggeſts. And in <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> the fanſie is ſo contracted within it ſelf, that it can neither receive Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Underſtanding, nor give it perfect Information from Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations made by the External Senſes, and ſo its follies are not corrected. But les the Original of theſe erroneous imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations or fallacies be what they will; this is certain, that they inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after the ſame manner into ſuch as dream, and ſuch as rather <hi>muſe</hi> than <hi>meditate</hi> upon the Scripture. Nor is there any other means to prevent their Inſinuations, beſide vigilant and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive alacrity to ſift and examine every circumſtance, by ſetting our thoughts a work to counterſway our extemporary conceits or apprehenſions, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary inducements poſſible. He that thinks of nothing, but of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his own concluſion or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion will preſently perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Word of God (eſpecially if he hear it alledged or quoted by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſpeaks juſt ſo as he thinks, and profers it ſelf as a witneſs to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

This is an argument of his diſingenuity, and ſtudy to ſerve a Party; that rather than ſay a word againſt it, he will let the moſt ſottiſh people think themſelves wiſe, nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to imagine we blaſpheme, if we tell them, they talk fooliſhly in Scripture phraſe.</p>

Though the world be cheated by them never ſo much; he will ſtand by them, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it that they mean honeſtly. For what is there, that he cannot make good by his <hi>it may be's,</hi> and ſuch like tools? <hi>It is poſſible,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that</hi> W. B. <hi>might mean not elevating, but humbling Viſions of God.</hi> Say you ſo Sir? Deal ſincerely I beſeech you: Did you read the place? What ſay you? Do not hum and haw, but ſpeak like a man, and ſay, whether did you look or no, into that Book which you undertook to juſtifie, to ſee what kind of <hi>Viſions</hi> he ſpoke of? If not; with what Conſcience durſt you become his Advocate, and take upon you to maintain you knew not what? Is this your way of writing Books? It gives men occaſion to think you ſcribled this to get a little mony, which you
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64706:112"/>hoped <hi>W. B</hi>'s. Friends would preſent you withal, not caring whether it were true or falſe. If you did; then I ask you, where were your eyes, that you could not ſee the inſtance whereby he explains himſelf, and that is of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding Chriſt transfigured, and ſaying, <hi>It is good to be here?</hi> Was this an <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Viſion,</hi> with which he was ſo tranſported? Or doth he ſpeak only of Gods <hi>giving counſel and comfort</hi> to his people (as you would have us think) when he expreſsly calls them <hi>Times of Raptures and Revelations?</hi> All this is within the compaſs of five or ſix lines in <hi>W. B</hi>'s Book; which makes me think it could not have eſcaped him, if he had lookt into it. And therefore I am of the opinion, that according to his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boldneſs, he wrote at all adventure; knowing very well the humour of thoſe he had to pleaſe, who would magnifie and cry up any thing for an Anſwer, though never ſo ſilly, nay, never ſo falſe. And though the impudent cheat be now diſcovered, <hi>it is poſſible</hi> (to ſpeak in his Style) that he hopes to eſcape well enough. For they can pardon ſuch ſins one to another, and ſhall ſtill be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Saints, though they lie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64706:112"/>and diſſemble the Truth. If he had had ſo much honeſty as he makes a ſhow of, he would have lookt upon this as a fit place to caution every one againſt ſuch bold pretences to Viſions and Revelations; which he knows are very dangerous, and not therefore to be wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, becauſe they are zealous people who talk of them. No body ſeemed to have a greater zeal than <hi>Tho. Muncer.</hi> He was for reforming even the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. He held <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf to be too cold: and ſaid his Sermons ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not enough of the Spirit. And by pretending to more frequent and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar converſation with God, and that he had Divine <hi>Revelations,</hi> and that God declared by <hi>Viſions</hi> his Will to the Saints, he got the reputation of a man extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily inſpired: and you know what was the end of it. He had a <hi>command from the Heavenly Father</hi> (that was his phraſe) to root up, and deſtroy, all the Princes and Magiſtrates of the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Chriſt ſaid, the <hi>Kings of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> to aboliſh alſo the Execution of juſtice, becauſe we read, <hi>reſiſt not evil;</hi> and to forbid all Oaths, to determine Controverſies, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> &amp;c.

And what by their profeſſed deteſtation of ſin, their great compaſſion to the common ſort, their ſoothing and ſtroking their followers, by appropriating to them all the ſavourable Titles, the good words, and the gracious promiſes in Scripture, and caſting the contrary alway on the heads of thoſe that oppoſed them; they ſtrangely prevailed.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64706:138"/>of Laws, not the cauſe upon which they ſeparated, as he would have the world believe.

No; it is unjuſtly called <hi>hard uſage,</hi> and to complain of this, as this Whifler doth (though the condition of ſome men become very ſad thereby) is to complain of all Churches, even of your own, when you had any power. It hath always been thought neceſſary in all places, that there ſhould be ſome Order kept in the Church of Chriſt: For which purpoſe they have found it as neceſſary that there ſhould be ſome Rules and Laws; which ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without Penalties to inforce them; and they as little, if they be not inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when men tranſgreſs.

Which ſuffering alſo, I muſt tell you, though it may conduce in the end much to their good, yet it puts their Governours to a new trouble to inflict it, after they have been long troubled, nay, perſecuted by their perverſneſs and fierce oppoſitions.

               <p>What? That I ſhould contrive all this and never know it? The good man hath plung'd himſelf ſo deep in a contradiction, that he is fain to fly to the Devil to help him out.

Which if the Faith of Chriſt have not purged out of my heart, <hi>I have no deſire to conſtrain my ſelf to think that it is poſſible</hi> I am a good Chriſtian. The very bottom of the buſineſs is this: It is not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but themſelves for which he is ſo much concerned and keeps all this ſtir. For the Queſtion is not, whether we ſhall all heartily and earneſtly ſtudy to be Godly, that is, to love and obey our Creator above all things, according to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; but whether you be the only godly, or ſo much beyond all others, as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine? and whether that be the Power of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64706:149"/>godlineſs, which is vulgarly called by that name. This I denied; and this made him ſo angry. Notwithſtanding which I ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that many among us, whom ſome of you make little account of, are more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly and ſubſtantially good, than many among you, upon whom you liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow that name; who value themſelves more upon the ſcore of <hi>keeping Days, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons, talking of Religion and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> than for <hi>Juſtice, Charity, ſpeaking Truth, Peaceableneſs, Meekneſs, Obedience,</hi> and ſuch like virtues, to which I find them very great ſtrangers.

The caſe is this; Becauſe in writing a Diſcourſe between two perſons of oppoſite perſwaſions and parties, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the one commending his Pariſh Prieſt (whom he muſt be ſuppoſed to hear) or rather vindicating him from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcorn which the other party poured on him, he infers that I commend my ſelf, and boaſt of my own reaſon and skill in the holy Scripture. He had beſt go and teach his Mother to ſuck; inſtruct the Univerſity in a new way of drawing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions; for no body ever learnt any ſuch Logick there. And till this upſtart Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſet Pen to Paper, any body might make two men maintain a Dialogue as long as he pleaſed, of matters diſputed between the Parties they adhered to, and never be thought he ſpoke of two ſingle perſons on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

In good time he may make an incomparable
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64706:153"/>Expounder of Books, if he do but follow (as he hath begun) thoſe Rules which paſſion and ſpight will dictate to him, and never let a ſober thought enter into his head.

Such is the perverſneſs of his humour, that he will interpret what I ſay, quite contrary ways, if thereby he can lay hold of any occaſion to cavil, and load me with the ill will and hatred of his credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Companions. As, for example, when he takes notice of what I ſaid concerning <hi>the black and white caps upon ſome N. C. Miniſters heads</hi>

               <p>A great deal the more, becauſe you are not ſenſible of the danger. For as if it were a ſmall matter to make ſuch a wide breach in our Church, you ſeek,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64706:167"/>to make it wider, by advancing your ſelves above all other men, diſparaging us and our Miniſters, and loading them with reproaches, as if they were not worthy to be named together with you. Which forces us to ſay that of you, which otherways ſhould never have come out of our mouths: though alas! it could not have been hid, you proclaim it ſo loudly your ſelves. This very <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> of yours hath given ſuch a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of you in his Book, as may ſatisfy all wiſe and ſober men, what you are; though we ſhould hold our peace. For he hath one faculty, you muſt know, wherein he ſurpaſſes moſt other writers, and that is, after he hath made a long diſcourſe to prove a thing, at laſt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow it all. Or to ſpeake in his own phraſe, he is ſuch a <hi>Cow</hi> as having given a great deal of Milk, throws it all down with her foot. For after all the evil he had ſaid of me, in concluſion, as I ſhowed you, he acknowledges ſo much goodneſs in me as is inconſiſtent with his accuſations. And in like manner after all the praiſes he had beſtowed on the <hi>N. C.</hi> for their piety, ſincerity, modeſty, patience and ſuch like things, in the end he grants the worſt things that I charged

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64706:175"/>profitably go with the ſame, both to humble to quicken and to comfort? For is the reading it ſelf unpure, when the Miniſter in his own behalf and the peoples uttereth them to God? I ſpeak not, you ſee, of the <hi>matter</hi> of prayer, but of <hi>reading</hi> it: for if the matter be naught, the pronouncing of it makes it not good any more then reading doth; if it be good and pure being uttered and pronounced, the reading cannot hurt it, or make it evil. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſatisfy them, they may know that in all Churches and the <hi>beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> there is a preſcript form of prayer uſed, <hi>and therefore they who are of a mind that it ought not to be, muſt ſeparate themſelves from all Churches.</hi> And then he concludes with a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to all good Chriſtians, to lay aſide contention and endleſs and (many of them alſo) needleſs Queſtions about this matter: And ſeeing it muſt of all who are <hi>well adviſed</hi> be granted, that the publique prayers are helps to ſtir up Gods graces in us, and to convey to us the many good bleſſings of God which we want: to look therefore to themſelves every way ſo carefully that they may be fit to be helped and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted

And there being in reſpect of place and company three ſorts of Prayer; <hi>Publique</hi> in the Church, <hi>private</hi> in the Family, and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> by a mans ſelf: he concludes that
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64706:178"/>the greateſt liberty may be taken in <hi>ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Prayer, by a mans ſelf; becauſe we are ſure, provided we be humble and upright, that God will not upbraid any man, for his Method, Order, Words or utterance. In <hi>private</hi> Prayer he thinks we may not take ſo great a Liberty as when alone: and juſtly fears that ſome well affected people have been ſomewhat faulty and offenſive in this; the weaker ſort being not ſo capable of that kind of Prayer which is called conceived or extemporall, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying every time in words, phraſe, manner and order, though the matter and ſubſtance be the ſame. But as for the <hi>publique</hi> Congregation, ſpecial care, he tells you, muſt be had that nothing be done in praying, preaching or admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Sacraments, but what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and orderly, becauſe there many eyes do ſee us, and many ears hear us; and upon this account it is expedient for the moſt part to keep a conſtant Form both of matter and words, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Is not the Spirit ſtraitned in ſtinted Prayer? And doth not a man find his Spirit bounded and limited when he is tyed to a Form?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That's the main objection, he tells you; to which he gives three ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Anſwers. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that thoſe very men who are againſt this and uſe this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, do the ſame thing daily in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; for when another prays, that is a Set Form to him that hears it; who hath no liberty to run out though his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould be more large; but is bound to keep his mind upon it. And therefore
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64706:179"/>if that were a ſufficient reaſon that a man might not uſe a ſet Form, becauſe the Spirit is ſtraitned, it would not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to hear another pray (though it were a conceived Prayer) becauſe in that caſe his Spirit is limited. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he tells you, though the Spirit be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at that time, yet he hath a liberty at other times to pray as freely as he will. It is no general ty, though he be then bound up. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he adds that there is no ty and reſtraint upon the Spirit, becauſe there is a ty to words. <hi>For the largneſs of the heart ſtands not ſo much in the multitude and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Expreſſions, as in the extent of the affections;</hi> which have no ty upon them, when we are tyed in words.</p>

And that Mr. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> exhorts to kneeling as the fitteſt geſture: And complains of thoſe that neglected it; as alſo of ſuch as would not ſit bare at the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64706:180"/>reading of the holy Scriptures: wiſhing withall that when we come in and go out of the Church we would give ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of ſuch reverence as now is rather derided than approved. By all which you may ſee without travelling through the reſt of the Authors which he mentions, that they will not down with your ſqueamiſh ſtomacks; and have been thruſt out of doors by a number of frivolous writers among you, who can better humour the childiſh fancies, and the corrupt appetites of the profeſſors of this Age.

               <p>No? that's ſtrange, why not as well as in drinking Wine? To me this ſeems far more the eaſier of the two. For men can have no more of a Play for their money, than the Actors have provided for them, but Wine they may have as long as their money laſts in their pockets, and longer too. And if there be any thing immodeſt or prophane in Playes, that may be eaſily remedied by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Revels, who, according to the Ancient conſtitution ought to ſee that nothing be ſpoken but what is fit to be heard. Many I am ſure who ſtand in need of ſome recreation, and find them no vnfitting Antidotes againſt melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and other untoward paſſions, deſire none but thoſe which are cleanly, and do no violence to honeſty. And they are not ſo dull but they conceive it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reconcile pleaſure with vertue, and that as there is a compoſed melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and folly, ſo there may be a free and merry wiſdom. You perhaps have not, but others have met with one, that tells them, there is an Art of uſing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure innocently; which was profeſſed anciently by <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> who
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:64706:190"/>never did any thing undecent or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, and yet was alwayes Merry. This Art, as the ſame perſon teaches them, was corrupted by <hi>Petronius</hi> and <hi>Tigellinus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who abuſed it as poyſoners do Phyſick. And therefore as heretofore Magiſtrates were created ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly to have a care of the pleaſures of the people, and beſides the Edicts of the <hi>Republick,</hi> there were under the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> a Tribune for pleaſures; ſo they heartily deſire it may be again. They would have none publiquely allowed, but what paſſes the ſevereſt judgment of Wiſe and ſober men: and would be glad to ſee ſuch a Science and Diſcipline of pleaſure, as that Gentleman ſaies be hath ſeen in the <hi>Formularies</hi> of <hi>Caſſiode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> They conclude, as he doth, that it is not juſt to accuſe the purity of things for the intemperance of men; and that it is not credible the good things of this life were made only for the wicked.</p>

This is the manifeſt ſcope of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: and I ſtill maintain it to be true, that a man may be of an Evangelical Spirit who is moved to do his duty out of a fear of what Chriſt threatens, as much as out of a hope of what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Nay, I do not ſee but one may have an Evang. Spirit, who is moved more by ſuch fear than he is by hope, though that was not the thing I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to make good.

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64706:197"/>as much by the one as by the other. By this you ſee either how dull and ſtupid he is, or how maliciouſly diſpoſed, who cannot underſtand ſo plain a diſcourſe. And yet he would have you think he is ſo ſagacious and hath ſo good a Noſe that he can ſmell

               <p>Can a man give greater glory and honour to God than by quitting his
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:64706:201"/>preſent pleaſures and other enjoyments, meerly in hope of good things to come which he doth not ſee, but only takes Gods word for? Doth he not magnifie the Goodneſs, the Truth, the Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Power of God, and declare the high thoughts he hath of all theſe glorious Attributes, who relyes purely on them for all his happineſs? There is nothing plainer at firſt ſight; upon which account I cannot retract what I have ſaid, but he ought rather according to his promiſe, to write no more on this faſhion. Let him reform his Sermons (a leaf or two of which he ſeems here to have tranſcribed) and talk more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly and diſcreetly of glorifying God. And above all things let him take care to expound the Scripture better, which he hath perverted moſt groſsly twice or thrice in this very Argument. Who, before him, expounded thoſe words <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10.1. <hi>[Iſrael is an empty Vine, he bringeth forth fruit to himſelf</hi>] of their having reſpect only to their own good in their Actions, and not to Gods glory? It is a place as many wayes rendred and expounded as any I can now call to mind: <hi>H. Zanchy</hi> hath been at the pains to enumerate two interpretations
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:64706:201"/>of <hi>Rabbi Salomon,</hi> another of Dr. <hi>Kimchi,</hi> a fourth of <hi>Aben-Ezra's</hi> (which is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hieromes</hi> alſo) in ſhort there are no leſs then 7. or 8. wayes of explicating theſe words, and yet none of them ſo much as lean towards the ſenſe which this great Cenſurer obtrudes upon us. <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius</hi> and others obſerve that they may be read with an interrogation, <hi>doth he bring forth fruit to himſelf?</hi> that is, doth he think the Enemy will leave him any thing, who hath already ſtript him ſo bare? No, he will take all away. Others render the words, <hi>He ſhall lay up the fruit,</hi> that is, of his ſins. A third expoſition is, <hi>he ſhall find no fruit,</hi> the reaſon is becauſe of his ingratitude. The ſimpleſt ſenſe of all <hi>Mercer</hi> thinks is this, <hi>as he is an empty vine, ſo he ſhall bring forth fruit like himſelf.</hi> i. e. none at all. As much as to ſay, he is ſpoiled by the Enemy, and deprived by God of the power of increaſing. This <hi>Zanchy</hi> alſo approves of as the beſt. But what needs ſo many words?

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:64706:202"/>of this above all. <hi>Iſrael is like a Vine, which having been ſpoiled one year, brings forth fruit again the next.</hi> The Lord vouchſafed his bleſſing to him, after he had let his vintage be deſtroyed. But what was the iſſue? The next words tell you; though God had let him bring forth fruit to himſelf not his Enemies, he grew worſe rather than better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>and according to the multitude of his fruit, he multiplyed his Altars.</hi> He that hath not theſe Books may look into the <hi>Dutch Annotations,</hi> who recite ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral expoſitions, but none of his. As for the <hi>Aſſemblies Annot:</hi> thoſe printed 1645. ſpeake not a word of it. But thoſe of the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi>. Edit: 1657. expound it firſt as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Calvin</hi> doth, he brings forth fruit <hi>to himſelf, not to others;</hi> but conſumes it on his own luſts and Idolatries; and then mentions ſome of thoſe named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

               <p>And ſo are many of thoſe who undertake to teach others: of whom the <hi>Quakers</hi> learnt to apply the Scripture according to the ſound of the words, not the ſenſe. For they cite theſe words of another prophet

                  </note> as learnedly <hi>[the Preiſts beare rule by their meanes]</hi> to prove that our Miniſters good livings keep up their Authority, as this man doth the words now named, to prove that a good man muſt eye the glory of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:64706:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>God and not only himſelf in what he doth; or the words of S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul [he hath choſen the weak things of this world to confound the mighty &amp;c.]</hi> to prove that God recovers men out of defections and deſpair by miſtakes or miſapplications of holy Scripture. p. 75.</p>

               <p>He pulls one half of my words from the other, and then makes a long babble upon them, conſiſting very much of impertinent compariſons inſtead of clear proofs and reaſons. I ſaid that by fanciful applications of ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or other not belonging to their condition, well meaning people are caſt down and again raiſed up &amp;c. This he cannot deny: and yet takes notice only of the latter, <hi>their recovery</hi> by miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods word, and lets the former paſs, their <hi>falling into malancholy</hi> by the ſame me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s. The reaſon is, becauſe he had no Queſtions to ask about that, nor any ſtories out of which to draw this concluſion, that God brings men into deſpaire, as he ſaith, he brings them out by miſtaking his meaning in his word. But abate him that, and yet,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:64706:203"/>he ſhall not hit the mark; for the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not, as he ſtates it whether a mans melancholy never had any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ground, becauſe he was cured by miſtake or miſapplication of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 73.</note> but whether men do not both fall into melancholy and again are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered out of it, merely by ſuch mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes or miſapplicatins. I ſay they do; and why he doth not honeſtly conſeſs it too, I cannot tell; unleſs it be that he may ſtill keep ſuch miſerable Patients under his cure, which he is better able to perform by miſapplying the holy Scripture then other ways. And that he may maintain this trade of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting poor Souls with mere words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſenſe, mark what a rabble of ſtories and examples he hath muſtered up, which hang together with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion like Harp and Harrow. Theſe are ſome of his arguments. A man was cured of a dangerous impoſthume by a ſtab which was intended to take away his life; therefore God cures men of their deſpair by miſapplications of holy Scripture. S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
                  <hi>Auſtin's</hi> life was ſaved by miſſing his way, when one lay in wait to kill him, therefore God delivers men from their trouble of mind, by
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64706:204"/>miſſing the ſenſe of his word. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elijah</hi> was fed by Ravens, and <hi>Jericho's</hi> Walls fell down by Rams-horns; therefore God conveys peace into mens hearts by their fanciful interpretations and miſtakings of what he ſaith.

               <p>This is the force of his reaſoning, as appeares further by the illuſtration which follows. A phyſitian is more to be admired, he tells you, who deceives his melancholy into a cure, than he that ſets him right by a long courſe of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. The conſequence of which is clearly this, that the more abſurd the conceit is by which he cures him the more he is to be admired: and ſo the further a thing is from the mind of God, the more glory it will be to him, if a man receive comfort by it. This according to one of his reſemblances, is like <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijahs</hi> being fed by a Raven, <hi>which
<note n="n" place="margin">

               <p>Now you have overthrown all he hath ſaid in a word. And happy would it be for him, and better much for you; if you could but teach him this one little peice of Logick. For this mad way of talking and preaching hath debauched Religion; and taught any man to ſet up
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:64706:205"/>for an inſtructor of others, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not common conſequence. It is but putting on a bold face, and quoting a great many Scriptures, and ſcraping up ſome ſtories, and making a ſhow with ſimilitudes and examples, and then pittying all others and ſighing over them as ſtrangers to the Mind and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of God; and without any more ado they ſhall be taken for great men by the Ignorant.

Or if they do not underſtand it, the difference is not ſo great but it may do as well. For Scripture misinterpreted can bring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from God and therefore why not other things. Say what you will, this confident folly ſhall be maintained. Such men as this are reſolved, it is plain, not only to countenance and defend the never to be too much lamented mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretation of Gods holy word, but to incourage and promote it; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſing God in it, nay, making it for his greater glory to convey peace into mens ſouls by this means.</p>

And whatſoever this man pretends, I doubt not, but the ground of that wrath which he, and others like to him, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt me, is only this; that they find their follies laid open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the view of the World. They are not ſo much concerned for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Religion, as appears by his being contented the Scripture ſhould be ſtill miſinterpreted, as for their own credit, which they think is impaired.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:64706:206"/>the place; but leaves out theſe material words for the finding the ſenſe, [<hi>and not unto men</hi>] and then expounds it thus; That we muſt have an eye to the glory of God and Chriſt in what we do, or elſe we ſhall not receive the reward, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apoſtle doth not oppoſe <hi>ſerving the Lord</hi> to <hi>ſerving themſelves,</hi> but to <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men</hi> (as appears by the words which he laid aſide, as lying croſs in his way) and would have them pleaſe their Maſters though Heathens, thinking all the while they were doing a part of Chriſts work; who would certainly pay them their wages, becauſe they were his Servants.

               <p>He ſpeaks diffidently and ſaith, <hi>Some it may be</hi> have tried. But let us take it for a certainty, and ſince you
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:64706:216"/>mention it let me ſay a few things briefly to it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> he acknowledges then the groſs ignorance and ſtupidity of your People (which I told you of the laſt time) who will ſooner joyn with <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> as he ſaith more than once
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 15. <hi>and</hi> 227.</note>; than with us of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> For that is his argument againſt perſwading them to be reconciled to us, that the next news we may hear of them ſhall be, that they have joyned themſelves to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts,</hi> or to the <hi>Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Secondly,</hi> it would be duly conſidered and ſadly laid to heart, how they came by theſe prejudices and antipathies againſt ſo ſober a way of worſhipping God as is among us. <hi>Let thoſe miſ-zealous men</hi> ſaith Bp. <hi>Hall
<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſwer to the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Smectym. Paragr.</hi> 13</note>, who have infuſed theſe diſtaſtes into well meaning Soules; See how they will anſwer it at the great day to the Judg of quick and dead. Surely if the caſe were mine, I ſhould fear it would fall heavy upon my Soul. Thirdly,</hi> let them all come back themſelves to our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, though they cannot bring the people with them. They will thereby do what in them lies to take away the ſcandal they have given; and they will alſo leave thoſe people, who when the humour takes them may leave them, and
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:64706:217"/>run to the wild ſects where ſtill they may enjoy more Liberty. It was a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento of Mr. <hi>Greenhams</hi> to <hi>Brown</hi> when he firſt ſeparated from our Church, that he hoped he might be better informed and return again to us, but he bid him bethink himſelf what would become of thoſe poor Souls whom he had ſeduced, and were carried away, who might run further and further from us, but never be reclaimed. His words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved true, for <hi>Brown</hi> returned and died a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but his Sect remains to the great diſturbance of it to this day. It had been well if all your Miniſters of this generation had thought of this, and ſo not begun to lead away ſo many Souls into a miſchievous Schiſm, who may never be reſtored: but as it is, if they cannot reduce them, let them come back themſelves, and not be worſe than the Father of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I have hope here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that they may do ſome good, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever this man ſaith, upon the better part of your People; if they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it unanimouſly and with all their heart. For what cannot be done by one man alone (whoſe unſucceſsful labours be untruly talks of) might be done to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:64706:217"/>great purpoſe if all were of the ſame pious mind, and joyned in the ſame good work by Doctrine and Example: decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that neither they nor their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors ever held there were any ſuch foul corruptions in our Worſhip or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as ſhould be a juſt ground for Separation. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> if there be no hope at all of this; what makes this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman talk of an <hi>Accommodation</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> between <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>N, C.</hi> and that a purpoſe of it ſeemed to be as it were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing very lately

               <p>Part of it I can. <hi>Praying by the Spirit,</hi> ſignifies in the holy language, as I take it, the uttering ſuch petitions as were immediately ſuggeſted, both mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words, by the Holy Ghoſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the neceſſities of the Church requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Such a gift I acknowledged there was in the Apoſtles dayes, but finding no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that it ſhould continue to ours, nor any ſuch qualification required by Sr. <hi>Paul</hi> in a Chriſtian Biſhop, I made bold to ſay that no man now can <hi>pray by the Spirit;</hi> meaning as the Apoſtle, did. Nor dare this man ſay the contrary; but pours out a great many words (as they are
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:64706:223"/>wont to do, when fewer would better become them) concerning the Spirits bringing ſome things to our minds; <hi>he cannot tell how much, nor how little;</hi>

                     <hi>See more in the Friendly Debiae, p.</hi> 88.</note> This he ſhould have oppoſed, and ſhown us that there is ſuch a Divine gift, which I deny. And affirm that the gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which is now ſo much talkt of, is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Natural,</hi> and partly <hi>acquired,</hi> by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, obſervation, and orderly digeſting of things in our minds. So that to the performance of what belongs to it in a compleat manner, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a <hi>competent knowledge</hi> of the Will of God revealed in the Holy Scriptures, where the matter of our Prayers is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy declared to us by Gods Spirit. Next of all, an <hi>orderly and diſtinct apprehenſion</hi> of thoſe things which we know: then a <hi>firm memory</hi> to keep them in mind and in that order: <hi>A ready invention</hi> alſo that we may find out what is moſt proper on all occaſions: together with an <hi>eaſie
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:64706:223"/>utterance</hi> and <hi>fluent expreſſion.</hi> All theſe are to be improved by <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>exerciſe;</hi> and when this gift is to be exerciſed in the preſence of others, ſome degree of <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>boldneſs</hi> is neceſſary, either from Nature, or acquired by frequent practice. And the greater the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is, and the more unacquainted we are with them, that we pray withal; the more of that quality laſt named is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him that makes the Prayer. If any of theſe be wanting, either there is no ſuch Gift, or it is very lame and defective, as Mr. <hi>Egerton</hi> obſerved it was not only in many of the common people (who thought they had it, when they had it not) but in ſome Reverend and worthy Miniſters too, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had it not, alwayes uſed a ſet Form of words both in the Church and in their private Families; And were men furniſhed with ſo much piety and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he could hardly prefer any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men before them.
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pract. of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. p.</hi> 690.</note> They that have a ſolid and clear underſtanding, but no more, have no ſuch gift as this. If there be ſuperadded a good Memory, but no quick Invention and Words ready to follow it, they will find themſelves at a loſs or confuſed ſometimes, even when no body hears them. And ſo may
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:64706:224"/>thoſe who have all theſe, if they have not withal got a habit of ſpeaking fitly by frequent exerciſe. Nay, they that have this habit, if they be too baſhful may find their gift fail them before a great Congregation. On the other ſide, we find that they who have little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and are indued only with a Memory, are wont to pray over the ſame phraſes, and put together the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral heads of a Sermon, ſometime in one order, ſometime in another, and that is all. As for the men of brisker Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, better Memories and whoſe tongues are well hung, though of a ſhallow Judgment; they will make a fairer ſhew and pleaſe themſelves and others with variety of expreſſions and conceits, when the matter is very mean, and many times but their private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions turn'd into Petitions. But as for them who beſide their weak Memories and want of underſtanding, are of a ſlow invention or expreſſion, and have only boldneſs and confidence equal to other mens knowledg and judgment, they will either hum and haw, or uſe endleſs tautologies, or ſpeak non-ſenſe, or piece it out with certain words which ſhall make a part in the beginning, end and middle of every Sentence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:64706:224"/>by it is apparent that very excellent men may wholy want this Gift, and others of little worth may have much of it, ſuch as it is. Nay, that men of great holineſs may be without it and bad men have it to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. For if they have furniſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with notions, and laid them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therin a method, and can hold them faſt ſo as they are diſpoſed in their Memories, and readily run to them, ſuddenly produce them, fit expreſſions to them, and be daunted with nothing; they may raviſh the people and themſelves too, though they have little or no ſenſe of God and goodneſs. He alſo that is but dull and ſlow, may be more ready and brisk when his fancy is heated, and find things coming faſter before him and preſenting themſelves in that order wherein they lay in his mind; ſo that one part of his Prayer ſhall be more taking than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But all this is nothing <hi>of the Spirit of Prayer,</hi> which conſiſts in ſuch things as I told you at the firſt, and muſt not now repeat, nor is it <hi>praying by the Spirit</hi> neither as any man may ſee that hath not a mind to deceive himſelf or others. It is not denyed but that when a good man ſeriouſly ſets himſelf to meditate, the Holy Spirit of God may, and I believe
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:64706:225"/>doth oftentimes, ſet things in better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before his mind, than he could caſt them into himſelf, and brings withal ſome things to his mind which he had forgot, and not only excites thoſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections in him which are ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what he intends to ask of God or thank him for, but raiſes him extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily above himſelf; and yet all this will not amount to a <hi>praying by the Spirit,</hi> but only by it's aſſiſtance. Whereby a man who hath a gift of extemporate ſpeech, ſometimes excels all that ever he delivered before, and yet no man will ſay he <hi>ſpoke by the Spirit.</hi> I muſt add alſo that notwithſtanding this aſſiſtance of the Divine Spirit, it is moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true that many have ſpoken to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment of their hearers (as I can prove from certain ſtories which you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are not acquainted with) who were not moved by the Holy Ghoſt at all; and other Devout men who have the Spirit of God as much as any, after all their premeditation, and digeſting things in their mind, have not been able to make ſuch prayers, nor found any ſuch aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (as this man would have us depend upon) to bring that matter on a ſudden to their mind which they had forgot or not thought upon. I have endeavoured
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:64706:225"/>to explain my mind as briefly and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly as I could about this buſineſs: in which notwithſtanding, I know, a man of ill will may find ſome word or other to ſnarl and cavil at. But if this man think good to continue ſtill in that humour. I ſhall throw one bone in his way for him to gnaw a little upon, which may perhaps ſomething a bate the edge of his fury. It is the words of a great man diſſatisfied with many things in our Church, who writing upon occaſion concerning this matter, confeſſes a great part of the moſt diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things that I have ſaid, and upon his own experience. <hi>Now what Worſhip,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>or prayers do you uſe? I am aſhamed to name the boldneſs and folly of ſome who ſcarce able to utter three words orderly, will yet take upon them to babble out a tedious and ſtuttering prayer, where in every tenth word ſhall be the repeating of O heavenly Father, O merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, O deare Father, O good God, O merciful God, &amp;c. and alſo ſo fooliſhly packed together that their praying ſeems rather to be the prating of an infant, that would tell ſome great tale but cannot hit it.</hi> Thus far the Reformer, and yet he ſaith not all as my Author

For my part, I pretend to no thing more than what I have told you, but only this; that I think it is an Art that may be very eaſily taught thoſe who are of an ordinary capacity, and which many people learn by imitation. It is plain the Boy was taught (after a faſhion) in a ſmall time, who was lately hanged for Murder; and it was no ſuch wonder when we conſider, that there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain forme and rode both of matter and words where many men are wont to run; only they chang their place, and put them in other rank and order. And as this is very eaſy for ſome men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſo it is very delightfull when they have it, which makes them ſo fond of it and ſo much to admire it. For their Spirits being heated and their fancy warmed, many things ſtart up on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which they thought not of before, and theſe ſurpriſe them with their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, and withal are apt to perſwade
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:64706:227"/>leſs cautious ſoules that now they are full of the Spirit of God.</p>

               <p>No indeed, I think it far more difficult to pray by a Book than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, if a man be able to do both. For beſide the delight which it gives the natural man to have new conceits ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up continually in his mind, and the joy he is apt to conceive from an opinion that then he is extraordinarily inſpired from above; it is no ſmall matter in his eſteem to have the whole publike Service of God rely upon his invention, and hang upon his lips. This makes him to be a <hi>little Pope,</hi> of another kind: upon whoſe mouth alone the Divine worſhip in the Church as much depends among you, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine faith doth on the Pope's mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Papiſt. There is this difference only (beſides the number which depend on each) that he takes a long time and much advice about his reſolutions of faith, and your worſhip oftentimes is but a ſudden effuſion.</p>
